    <h1>Lviv Croissant</h1>
    <p>Lviv Croissants is a company that in 7 years has grown into a national franchise network with a wide range of large freshly baked croissants with various fillings. <br>
What was the impetus for opening this business? Every business starts with an idea. During another food testing for a new menu, which included croissants for tasting, an unforeseen situation occurred. <br>
Accidental non-observance of defrosting and baking technology resulted in extremely tasty large croissants. It was this case that laid the foundation for the successful business of Lviv Croissants.</p>
